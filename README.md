<b>NFkB Base: A specialized database of NFkB proteins</b>
<p>
NFkB transcription factors play a critical role in transcriptional activation and are associated with a wide range of important cellular processes involving cell proliferation and survival and the immune response. In addition to experimental and structural data, protein sequences of NFkB have important research value for functional characterization of the protein family. As of March 2011, while a large number of NFkB protein sequences can be found in major sequence databases, there is no specialized, publicly accessible database specifically for NFkB protein sequences, though datasets containing NFkB target genes areavailable online. This presents a need for a centralized repository containing an annotated dataset of NFkB protein sequences to fill the gap in current resources on NFkB.

NFkB Base is a specialized database of experimentally verified, manually curated NFkB protein sequences. The database is integrated with analysis tools including (i) dynamic data display, (ii) keyword search and (iii) Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) sequence search. The main aim of NFkB Base is to support and facilitate large-scale sequence and functional studies of NFkB proteins.

NFkB Base was part of my MSc research on understanding the functional roles of intrinsic protein disorder in NFkB Transcription factors. A copy of my Msc thesis can be downloaded from:
