<p class="header">About NF-kB proteins</p>
The NF-kB (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells) or 
Rel protein family consists of a group of ubiquitously expressed, 
highly inducible and structurally-related eukaryotic transcription factors, 
found to be involved in a variety of diverse cellular and organismal processes,
including the cellular stress response, cell proliferation and survival, 
apoptosis, inflammation and innate and adaptive immunity. 
<p>Related by a highly conserved NH2-terminal Rel homology domain (RHD) 
responsible for DNA-binding and dimerization, NF-kºB proteins can be divided
 into two functionally distinct classes, based on their C-terminus sequence 
that are capable of homo- and hetero- dimerizing. The activated homo- and 
hetero-dimers  are exported from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, where it binds 
to ÎºB sites in the regulatory regions of inducible promoters for the
 activation of target gene expression. The subunit composition of the NF-ÎºB
 complex affects its DNA-binding site specificity, subcellular localization, 
transactivation potential and mode of regulation, thus leading to combinatorial
 diversity of the downstream responses.
